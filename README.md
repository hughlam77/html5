# html4 - html5
SeaLink HTML4 to HTML5 by Hugh Lam

As requested via email, I attempted to refactor the HTML 4 code from GIST into HTML5.

Some notes:

I was planning to create a seperate .css, but was not sure if everything needed to be in a single file. So I decided to make it an internal style.

There were a few areas where I was afraid of changing as I wanted to retain much of the original document as possible (minimise the impact to the original document).

I used jsfiddle.net to render my changes and also used the HTML 5 Validation service provided by W3C.

Thanks for the opportunity!

Hugh
